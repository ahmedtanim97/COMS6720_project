What is the effect of the parasite on the host fish?
What is the effect of the parasite on the local fish populations and on fisheries?

What has happened in this research since 2012?  
Do we know more about the importance of multiple symbionts in coral with regard to resilience?
What possible human interventions could increase resilience based on this new knowledge of multiple symbionts?
Does the ability to host multiple symbionts make a coral more resilient or is it just passively significant?
How much do we now know about the heat tolerance of specific algal symbionts and what is the significance/application of this knowledge?
What is the relevance of this study on the greater application of disease “treatment” when this is such a small sample size and because the findings only show a minimal slowing of the disease process in treated corals?
What are the possible applications of this study’s findings given the manpower needed to “treat” coral and monitor their progress weekly?
With varying disease ecology based on coral genera, how can we apply this universally to coral restoration and disease prevention?  What is the necessary follow-on research on disease ecology?
Is coral disease pre-cursored by a change in bacteria, or do all parts of a diseased coral change as a result of the infection?
Where did the Vibrio owensii that was found in the coral in the study come from (it was stated that it was the first known record of the organism being associated with lesions in coral).
How can future studies map the disease progression from initial onset in-situ or in a laboratory environment?
Is the root cause of coral predation on infected polyps related to size, availability, texture, or other factors - how do we further assess this relationship?
What is the relationship between the level of parasite infection and the restriction of coral growth?
How has AI and LLM models, along with other technologies, changed the ways that we can monitor and understand these reef systems and the changes studies in this paper?
The study found that there was a change in the predominant lagoon species from 1971 to 2000/2002.  What was the main reason for this change and what other studies support these findings?
Why is there a large discrepancy in the findings of the Grigg (1982) study and the Siciliano (2006) study regarding the accretion rates and ability of the reef to keep up with the pace of sea-level rise in Kure?
Have subsequent studies been able to continue this line of research so that scientists can avoid the issue of shifting baselines?
The study posits that the data presented will “ensure that significant three-dimensional structure is available to support biodiversity ay mesophotic depths” - how?
How much do reefs self-balance as a result of mechanical and chemical bioerosion in the face of consistent environmental change?
What mechanism of macro-boring do sponges use to destroy a reef?
Is it valid to compare bioerosion on shallow and deep reefs given all of the differences in the habitat including both physical and chemical as well as biological differences?
Can we use technology and AI to measure the density of coral at the mesophotic reefs to get a better understanding of the ecosystem and its mechanisms?
