Question,Ground truth
What temperature do most coral reefs around the globe/world live with?,The majority of coral reefs around the globe live with temperatures usually not exceeding 29°C.  
What salinity do most coral reefs around the world/globe live with?,The majority of coral reefs around the globe live with salinities around 36 PSU.  
Are diseases amongst coral reefs common?,"Coral like most living creatures are susceptible to disease, Disease typically will not occur in high rates, in a recent survey of more than 75.000 corals, only 207 (0.17%) were found to show signs of disease."
What is an assumption common in models that predict the future of coral cover?,Models that predict the future coral cover of reefs typically assume that corals will be unable to compensate for increasing temperatures over relatively short timescales
When conducting experiments in the field how do people capture the positions of the coral to make sure they continue to look at the same piece?,"Common methods include tagging, photographing, and recording positions using GPS."
What is a drawback to lesion removal on diseased coral?,It can be somewhat difficult to do and time consuming.
What is a common and damaging coral disease on reefs in American Samoa?,Acropora white syndrome (AWS)
How might the ability to host multiple Symbiodinium clades help corals adapt to climate change?,"Hosting diverse algal partners increases flexibility, allowing corals to shift to more heat-tolerant clades, improving their survival under rising temperatures"
What relationship was observed between coral bleaching and disease prevalence in the Red Sea study?,A negative relationship was found—sites with more bleaching tended to have lower disease prevalence
Why is coral disease prevalence in the Red Sea considered unusual despite high temperature stress?,"Because the region experiences high temperatures but low terrestrial runoff, suggesting that minimal land-based pollution may help keep disease levels low despite heat stress"
