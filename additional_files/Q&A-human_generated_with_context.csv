What temperature do most coral reefs around the globe/world live with?,"The ecological implications of the roles played by parrotfishes in tropical reef ecosystems are discussed in the work by Bellwood DR and Choat JH (1990), which provides a functional analysis of grazing in parrotfishes, and in the review by Bonaldo RM, Hoey AS, and Bellwood DR (2014), which outlines the ecosystem roles of parrotfishes on tropical reefs.",Most coral reefs around the globe live with temperatures usually not exceeding 29¡C.,"The majority of coral reefs around the globe live with temperatures usually not

Are diseases amongst coral reefs common?,"Remote sensing technologies face challenges in resolving processes such as wind wakes and wake eddies, which are likely responsible for producing pelagic ""habitat"" conditions that attract individuals and sub-populations to specific regions.","Yes, diseases amongst coral reefs are common, as indicated by the prevalence of coral diseases in regions such as the Caribbean and the Great Barrier Reef.","Diseases of corals.

What is an assumption common in models that predict the future of coral cover?,"The presence of parasites like Plagioporus sp. affects the growth and health of coral species such as Porites compressa by causing an overall reduction in growth rate. Infected polyps appear swollen and are unable to retract adequately, which suggests that there is a cost to the polyps and that their contribution to the growth of the coral colony may be reduced.",A common assumption in models that predict the future of coral cover is that corals will be unable to compensate for increasing temperatures over relatively short timescales.,"An
assumption of these models is that corals will be unable to
compensate for increasing temperatures over relatively
short timescales.","M
odels predict that reef ecosystems throughout much of
the tropics will decrease in coral cover, diversity and/or
undergo phase shifts in the coming decades [30Ð33].",Model of a coral reef ecosystem.,Model of a coral reef ecosystem.
When conducting experiments in the field how do people capture the positions of the coral to make sure they continue to look at the same piece?,"Infected polyps appear swollen and are unable to retract adequately, which suggests that there is some cost to the polyps and that their contribution to the growth of the coral colony may be reduced.",The provided information is insufficient to answer this question.,"Coral recruits present on the plates 
were counted and measured with the 
use of a dissecting microscope.","Digital photographs recorded 
in 2003 were sampled at 30-sec intervals and quantitatively analyzed for coral percent 
cover using point-count software (Coral Point Count with Excel Extension, Kohler and 
Gill, 2006), using 50 randomly stratified points per frame.","Three complementary methods (towed-diver surveys, video transects, 
and photoquadrats) were used to quantify percent cover of corals by genus or species 
in the fore-reef, back-reef, and lagoon habitats.","Habitat digital videotapes recorded in 2000 and 2002 were sampled 
at 30-sec intervals (interframe distance ~ 22 m) and quantitatively analyzed for coral 
percent cover using the methods of Kenyon et al. (2006b)."
What is a drawback to lesion removal on diseased coral?,"The key components of a bleaching response plan for coral reef systems include the identification of specific groups and actions that should take place prior to a bleaching event, during the event, and follow-up actions after sea surface temperatures (SSTs) have returned to normal. Additionally, the plan involves identifying resilient areas based on monitoring data, research projects, past bleaching events, and modeling.","A drawback to lesion removal on diseased coral is that it may not address the overarching drivers of coral disease, such as nutrient runoff, overfishing, and rising seawater temperatures, which are necessary for maintaining the long-term viability of coral reefs (Bruckner 2002).","Although somewhat time consuming, lesion removal
would be effective in controlling disease in closed
systems such as coral nurseries, at the onset of a dis-
ease outbreak, on reefs with a low incidence of
cMWS, or for treating colonies that are of the most
value to the reef (Raymundo et al. 2008).","Similar treatment methods
employing lesion removal have proven successful for
mitigating the damage inflicted by certain coral dis-
eases (Hudson 2000, Dalton et al. 2010, Williams
2013, Aeby et al. 2015).","Because corals are effi-
cient at healing injuries (i.e. re-growth of tissue)
(Henry & Hart 2005, Work & Aeby 2010), the burden
of healing wounds created by the removal of disease
lesions should not have long-term impacts on the
coral colonies.","While
lesion removal has proven beneficial for cMWS-
infected colonies, management actions that address
the overarching drivers of coral disease (e.g. nutri-
ent runoff from human and animal waste, overfish-
ing, and rising surface seawater temperatures) are
required to maintain the long-term viability of coral
reefs (Bruckner 2002)."
What is a common and damaging coral disease on reefs in American Samoa?,"The differing population trends of Hawaiian monk seals across various locations are influenced by factors such as location-specific declines, reasons for those declines, and low juvenile survival rates. Additionally, long histories of human disturbance at Midway and Kure likely contribute to their low population numbers.",Acropora white syndrome (AWS) is a common and damaging coral disease on reefs in American Samoa.,"One of the most common and damaging coral dis-
eases on the reefs within American Samoa is Acropora
white syndrome (AWS) (Fig. 1a) (Aeby et al., 2009).",Coral disease across the Hawaiian Archipelago.,Coral reef diseases in the wider Caribbean.,Coral Disease on the Great Barrier Reef.
