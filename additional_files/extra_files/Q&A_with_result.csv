What temperature do most coral reefs around the globe/world live with?,The majority of coral reefs around the globe live with temperatures usually not 60 exceeding 29°C and salinities around 36 PSU.  ,Most coral reefs around the globe live with temperatures usually not exceeding 29°C.,"cooler winter temperatures are thought to reduce coral growth rates. While the summer temperatures are generally similar along the entire NWHI, the warmest summer temperatures tend to occur at the three north­ernmost atolls, presumably caused by reduced mixing due to weaker winds (situated closer to the center of the North Paciﬁc high pressure ridge) and decreased circulation due to large shallow water lagoons (Brainard et al., 2004; Hoeke et al., 2005). Roughly two-thirds of the variability in growth rate across the archipelago can be explained by changes in temperature and light availability (Grigg, 1982). Growth rates for a representative species of coral (P. lobata) dominant throughout the chain vary from 3 mm/yr to 13 mm/yr (Grigg, 1982). 
Siciliano (2005), however, reports that, while coral growth rates generally decline as a function of increasing latitude in the NWHI, as originally suggested by Grigg (1982), this decrease is habitat-speci ﬁc.

Community Development at High Latitudes 
To redefine the environmental limits over which reefs exist today and to identify 
“marginal” reefs, i.e., those near or beyond “normal” environmental limits of reef 
distribution, Kleypas et al. (1999) assessed five environmental variables (temperature, 
salinity, light, carbonate saturation state, nutrients) considered to be first-order 
determinants of global reef distribution. With minimum weekly sea surface temperatures 
that fall to 17ºC (Coral Reef Ecosystem Division, unpubl. data), Kure conforms to a 
criterion by which reefs may be said to exist in a “marginal” environment. Despite Kure’s 
status as the world’s northernmost atoll (Dana, 1971), coral cover values in the three 
geomorphic habitats are comparable to those of more southerly atolls in the Northwestern 
Hawaiian Islands that have been quantified by methods and over time periods similar to","25501 diseases [2,13].  Yet, we found corals existing in this challenging environment to have 
502 surprisingly low disease levels (<1%).  Moreover, our surveys were conducted in the midst of a 
503 bleaching event.  This suggests acclimation/adaptation to prevailing environmental conditions 
504 [19,100] and notably, the Red Sea is an arid region with minimal terrestrial run-off and almost no 
505 riverine input [18].  At our sites, we saw little evidence of sedimentation, water clarity was good 
506 and there was little macroalgae on the reef (<1%).  Coastal coral reefs in other regions are 
507 increasingly exposed to excess nutrients, sediments, and pollutants discharged from land which 
508 are known to degrade local reefs [25] including increasing coral disease prevalence.  Haapkyla et 
509 al. [11] found  a 10-fold greater mean abundance of disease on reefs during the rainy summer","Despite their high latitude location, slightly more species of coral have been reported from the NWHI (52 spe­
cies) compared with the MHI (48 species; Maragos et al., 2004), although a number of potentially new species have recently been discovered (Friedlander et al., 2008). Kure is the world’s most northern atoll (28° 26’N) and is referred to as the Darwin Point, where coral growth and subsidence /erosion balance one another (Grigg, 1982). Beyond this point lies a chain of seamounts that get progressively deeper and older as they move away from a stationary melting point or hot spot in the Paci ﬁc plate located southeast of the big island of Hawaii 
(Grigg, 1988).

tains a large number of endemics (ap­proximately 30%), including at least sev­en species of table corals (acroporids), which are the dominant reef-building coral in the Indo-Paci ﬁc, but are absent",1,1,1,0.947012175,0.933263118,0.733315779
Are diseases amongst coral reefs common?,"Coral like most living creatures are susceptible to disease, Disease typically will not occur in high rates, in a recent survey of more than 75.000 corals, only 207 (0.17%) were found to show signs of disease.","Yes, diseases among coral reefs are common, as coral disease has emerged as a serious threat to coral reefs worldwide.

Changing climatic conditions as well as local anthropogenic stressors have been implicated in increased disease levels but our ability to fully understand recent disease outbreaks is hampered by the paucity of baseline and epidemiological information on the normal disease levels in the ocean (Harvell et al., 1999, 2002).

What is a drawback to lesion removal on diseased coral?,It can be somewhat difficult to do and time consuming.,"A drawback to lesion removal on diseased coral is that it can potentially increase susceptibility to some diseases due to the mechanical injury caused by the removal process. This injury may create an open wound that can become infected or lead to systemic changes that weaken the coral, making it more vulnerable to disease. Additionally, while lesion removal may be effective in the short term, it does not address the overarching drivers of coral disease, such as nutrient runoff and rising seawater temperatures, which are necessary for the long-term viability of coral reefs.","same reef under similar environmental conditions.Although somewhat time consuming, lesion removalwould be effective in controlling disease in closedsystems such as coral nurseries, at the onset of a dis-ease outbreak, on reefs with a low incidence ofcMWS, or for treating colonies that are of the mostvalue to the reef (Raymundo et al. 2008). Whilelesion removal has proven beneficial for cMWS-infected colonies, management actions that addressthe overarching drivers of coral disease (e.g. nutri-ent runoff from human and animal waste, overfish-ing, and rising surface seawater temperatures) arerequired to maintain the long-term viability of coralreefs (Bruckner 2002).

Equally important to the initialdisease response, however, is the follow-up researchrequired to identify and understand","tively halted disease progression in 80% of thecolonies (Dalton et al. 2010). In addition, removal ofgrowth anomalies on branching acroporids in thecentral Pacific (Northern Line Islands) resulted in90% of colonies remaining disease free for 9 mo post-treatment (Williams 2013). Because corals are effi-cient at healing injuries (i.e. re-growth of tissue)(Henry & Hart 2005, Work & Aeby 2010), the burdenof healing wounds created by the removal of diseaselesions should not have long-term impacts on thecoral colonies. Although potentially confounding evi-dence has been reported that wounds can increasesusceptibility to some diseases (Aeby & Santavy2006, Page & Willis 2008), the above-mentioned
treatments remain a potentially important means ofcontaining some types of disease outbreaks in theshort term. The increasingly numerous records ofsuccessful disease treatments will aid resource man-agers in addressing the growing threat of coral dis-ease outbreaks.","Previous research has proposed that disruption of
the coral animal through mechanical injury increasessusceptibility to some diseases (Aeby & Santavy2006, Page & Willis 2008), suggesting that corals areeither more susceptible because they have an openwound that can subsequently become infected orthat some systemic change takes place to weakenthe entire organism, thereby making it generallymore susceptible to disease. In our study, althoughtreated colonies were re-infected with cMWS withina few weeks post-lesion removal, new infectionsnever occurred at the removal site, indicating thattissue disruption was not required for cMWS initia-tion. In addition, the development of new lesionswas similar between the 2 groups, suggesting thatthe processes affecting cMWS pathogenesis contin-ued throughout the experiment regardless of coralwounding.
It is possible that a fundamental difference exists","While morbidity- and mortality-reducing tech-
niques have been developed for many plant and ani-mal species (Nandakumar et al. 2001, Warrell et al.2008), only a few are available for corals. Therefore,our objective was to test lesion removal as a methodof disease treatment to reduce morbidity or mortalityfrom tissue loss associated with cMWS lesions.

loss leading to partial to total colony mortality depend-ing on the coral species affected and has been found tobe transmissible through direct contact in controlledstudies (Aeby et al. , 2011); histological analyses of tissues
