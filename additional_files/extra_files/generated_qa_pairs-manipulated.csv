Question,Ground Truth
What is BBD and where has it been reported?,"BBD stands for Black Band Disease, which is a disease affecting coral reefs. It has been reported from coral reefs across the world, including the Red Sea."
What pattern of prevalence was observed for BBD in the Red Sea?,"The pattern of prevalence observed for BBD (black band disease) in the Red Sea indicated that it typically remains at low background levels, with seasonal outbreaks occurring. Specifically, at the study sites, there was a low prevalence of infected corals (0.02-0.12%) found at seven out of 22 sites. The average BBD prevalence was highest in Al Lith (0.33%), mainly due to one outbreak site, while no cases were found in the northern-most region (Yanbu). BBD infections were more common in summer months when water temperatures and light levels are higher and usually disappeared during colder winter months."
What type of waves pose the most significant disturbance to Hawaiian reefs?,"Large waves generated by the North Pacific swell, which approach from the north or northwest, pose the most significant wave disturbance to Hawaiian reefs."
Which coral species dominates the highest coral cover on Kure fore reefs?,The coral species that dominates the highest coral cover on Kure fore reefs is Porites lobata.
What is the average number of parasites per host for infected fish in Hawai’i?,The average number of parasites per host for infected fish in Hawai’i is 6.9.
What factors may contribute to the increased prevalence of S. istiblenni in Hawai’i?,"The increased prevalence of S. istiblenni in Hawai’i may be contributed by several factors:

1. **Loss of Competing Gut Parasites**: The absence of competing gut parasites may benefit S. istiblenni, allowing it to thrive.

2. **Reduced Host Stress**: Host fish may experience reduced stress from competitors and other parasites, creating a more favorable environment for S. istiblenni.

3. **Favorable Habitat**: The introduced range may offer more suitable habitat conditions for the parasite.

4. **Large Host Populations**: An abundance of host fish, including intermediate and definitive hosts, can enhance transmission rates of the parasite.

5. **Presence of Alternative Hosts**: The existence of alternative hosts not found in the native range may also contribute to increased infection rates.

These factors may be working in conjunction to result in the increased prevalence and intensity of S. istiblenni in the introduced range."
How might the loss of competing gut parasites affect S. istiblenni in Hawai’i?,"The loss of competing gut parasites in Hawai’i may benefit S. istiblenni by allowing it to increase in prevalence and intensity. With fewer competitors for resources within the host fish, S. istiblenni could thrive more effectively, potentially leading to higher infection rates. Additionally, the reduced stress from both competitors and parasites may create a more favorable environment for S. istiblenni to flourish."
What types of marine habitats are described in the assessment?,"The assessment describes marine habitats that include basalt surfaces exposed to high wave action, habitats for spiny lobsters (Panulirus marginatus) and slipper lobsters (Scyllarides squammosus), and shallow waters with minimal reef growth. It also mentions habitats with high benthic relief, particularly in depths of less than 27.4 m."
Which species of lobsters are mentioned as being found in the bank habitat?,The species of lobsters mentioned as being found in the bank habitat are spiny lobsters (Panulirus marginatus) and slipper lobsters (Scyllarides squammosus).
What geological features indicate the effects of wave action in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands?,"The effects of wave action in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands are indicated by geological features such as spur and groove formations, and the distribution of benthic communities. High-energy environments typically feature energy-tolerant species, such as crustose coralline algae, non-delicate fleshy algae, and encrusting Porites corals, which thrive in areas exposed to significant wave disturbances. In contrast, sheltered areas may support different species of corals and algae that require quiescent habitats."
What is the Darwin Point and its significance in atoll formation?,"The Darwin Point marks the threshold in atoll formation where vertical growth, or net accretion, of reef-building organisms is zero or negative. This point indicates that as a volcanic edifice subsides, the atoll can no longer maintain its structure and begins to drown, transforming into a guyot. Named after Charles Darwin, who proposed an evolutionary model for atoll formation in 1836, the Darwin Point is significant because it represents a crucial milestone in the life cycle of a Hawaiian volcano. Beyond this point, coral growth cannot keep pace with subsidence, leading to the eventual submergence of the atoll. Kure Atoll is currently near its Darwin Point and is considered the oldest Hawaiian island still above sea level."
How do coral reef communities relate to the tops and edges of volcanoes?,"Coral reef communities are closely related to the tops and edges of volcanoes that are at or near sea level. These areas support large and diverse coral reef communities because the volcanic structures provide a suitable habitat for coral growth. As the volcanic edifice subsides over time, reef builders (coral organisms) continue to grow vertically, maintaining the top of the volcano near sea level by creating a thick carbonate cap. This dynamic allows coral reefs to thrive in these environments, but once the volcanic structure reaches the Darwin Point, where vertical growth or net accretion of these organisms becomes zero or negative, the atoll can drown and transform into a guyot."
What is the current status of Kure Atoll in relation to its Darwin Point?,"Kure Atoll currently lies very near its Darwin Point, which is the threshold where the vertical growth or net accretion of reef building organisms is zero or negative. This means that Kure Atoll is at a stage where coral growth can no longer keep pace with the rate of geological subsidence. As a result, it is the oldest Hawaiian island still above sea level, but it consists of only 1 km² of emergent land and is experiencing ongoing subsidence."
What is the saturation horizon and its significance for calcium carbonate structures?,"The saturation horizon is the depth in the ocean at which the concentration of carbonate ions is critical for the stability of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) structures. Above this depth, calcium carbonate can precipitate and form solid structures, such as those found in corals and calcareous algae. Below the saturation horizon, calcium carbonate tends to dissolve due to the lower concentrations of carbonate ions.

The significance of the saturation horizon for calcium carbonate structures is that it determines the depth at which organisms like corals can effectively calcify and build their skeletons. As anthropogenic CO2 emissions increase, the saturation horizon moves shallower, meaning that the depth where corals can calcify becomes increasingly limited. This has implications for coral ecosystems, as it affects their ability to grow and thrive in deeper waters."
How does increased CO2 in seawater affect the saturation horizon and coral calcification?,"Increased CO2 in seawater leads to a decrease in the concentration of carbonate ions, which in turn affects the saturation horizon. The saturation horizon is the depth at which calcium carbonate structures, such as those produced by corals, tend to dissolve. As more CO2 is released into the atmosphere and absorbed by the ocean, the saturation horizon moves shallower. This means that the depth at which corals are able to calcify also becomes shallower, making it more challenging for corals to maintain their calcium carbonate structures in increasingly acidified waters."
What types of echinoderms were surveyed in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands?,"The types of echinoderms surveyed in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands included sea urchins (echinoids), sea stars (asteroids), and sea cucumbers (holothuroids). The most common echinoid was the burrowing sea urchin, Echinostrephus sp., and the most common sea star was Linckia multifora."
