Community Structure and Wave Exposure 
Wave exposure is a major determinant controlling the development of Hawaiian 
coral reefs ( Dollar, 1982; Storlazzi et al., 2005; Jokiel, 2006 ). Moberly and Chamberlain 
(1972) described four types of ocean swell, varying in their magnitude and frequency, 
which affect reef development in Hawaii: North Pacific winter swell, northeast trade 
wind waves, Southern Ocean swell, and kona storm-generated waves. Of these, large 
waves generated by the North Pacific swell, which approach from the north or northwest, 
pose the most significant wave disturbance to Hawaiian reefs (Grigg, 1998; Friedlander","These large wave events, greater than 10 m, inﬂuence the growth forms and distribution of coral reef or­
ganisms (Dollar, 1982; Dollar and Grigg, 2004; Grigg et al., 2008) and affect the reproductive performance of winter-breeding seabirds nesting on low islets in the Monument. Most large wave events, 5 to 10 m, approach the NWHI from the west, northwest, north and northeast, with the highest energy generally occurring from the northwest sector. The southern sides of most of the islands and atolls of the NWHI are exposed to fewer and weaker wave events. Annually, mean wave energy and wave power (energy transferred across a given area per unit time) are highest (approximately 1.3 W/m) be­tween November and March and lowest (approximately 0.3 W/m) between May and September (Figure 2.5). Extreme wave events, 10 m or higher, affect shal­low water coral reef communities with at least an order of magnitude more ener­gy than the typical winter waves (Grigg et al., 2008).","Benthic Communities

sector-specific value from towed-diver surveys (7.2%, Table 1), video transects (6.0%), 
and photoquadrats (6.0%). The dominance of Porites  with massive and encrusting growth 
forms on the fore reef (Tables 1,2, Fig. 3) is consistent with the top ranking of Porites 
lobata  from Maragos et al. (2004) but differs from the top ranking of Porites compressa

ABSTRACT 
The distribution and abundance of scleractinian corals at Kure Atoll in the 
Northwestern Hawaiian Islands was determined by georeferenced towed-diver surveys 
that covered close to 27,000 m2 of benthic habitat and site-specific surveys at 21 sites 
during 2000–2003. Three complementary methods (towed-diver surveys, video transects, 
and photoquadrats) were used to quantify percent cover of corals by genus or species 
in the fore-reef, back-reef, and lagoon habitats. Three genera, Porites , Pocillopora,  and 
Montipora , accounted for more than 99% of the coral cover throughout the atoll, although 
their relative abundances vary considerably according to habitat and geographic sector 
within habitats. Fore-reef communities are dominated by massive and encrusting Porites","The average coral cover across 16,663 m2 surveyed along the fore reef was 9.7% 
(Table 1). The differences among the eight fore-reef sectors in the average total percent 
coral cover were statistically significant (Kruskal-Wallis test, H = 184.59, df = 7, p < 
0.001), and there were significant differences among sectors in the relative abundance of 
coral genera present (chi-square test, Χ2 = 231.60, df = 7, p < 0.001). Total coral cover 
was highest along the arc of the fore reef proceeding counterclockwise from the north to 
the west sector, where Pocillopora dominated. Total coral cover was less in the southwest 
sector, where Pocillopora  codominated with massive/encrusting Porites . Relatively lower 
coral cover was found along the arc of the fore reef proceeding counterclockwise from 
the south to the northeast sector, where massive/encrusting Porites  accounted for nearly 
two-thirds or more of the coral cover. Porites compressa , Montipora , and other taxa","Ten scleractinian taxa were seen in Kure photoquadrats ( Table 3 ). The differences 
among the three habitats in their relative abundance of coral taxa were statistically 
significant (chi-square test, Χ2 = 266.52, df = 6, p < 0.001). The fore reef and back reef 
were dominated by Porites lobata  (Table 2, Fig. 3b). Representation by Pocillopora  was 
highest on the fore reef (42.8% of total), while representation by Montipora was highest 
on the back reef (14.4% of total). Of the three distinguishable species of Pocillopora  
present in photoquadrats, P . meandrina  composed 80.8% of the total pocilloporid cover 
throughout the atoll using this method. Similar to results from towed-diver surveys and 
video transects, the lagoon was dominated by Porites compressa (Table 2, Fig. 3b).",0.9166666666361111,1.0,1.0,0.9853270462107067,1.0,1.0

Conclusion
Here, we synthesize phylogeography, population genetics, and
ecological survey data to confirm the alien status of the
cryptogenic parasitic nematode S. istiblenni in Hawai’i. This species
was brought to Hawai’i over 50 years ago during well-intentionedefforts to enhance local fisheries. The outcome for fisheries has
been just the opposite, with L. kasmira regarded as a nuisance and,
by some, as a threat to native species. Here we show that the
introduced fish also brought an unwelcome passenger, S. istiblenni .
Once introduced, S. istiblenni attained a two-fold increase in
prevalence, as well as a similar increase in intensity. S. istiblenni lags
behind its primary host L. kasmira in the introduced range but there
is no obvious barrier to colonization of the entire Hawaiian","Pacific is poorly documented, and the uncertainty in the natural
range of S. istiblenni stems from a lack of occurrence data. Outside
of Hawai’i, S. istiblenni is known only from French Polynesia and
Fiji [22], [23] (reexamination of materials from Okinawa hascalled into question the accuracy of earlier records [23]). Based onbiogeographic data from reef fish species, the most likely route ofnatural dispersal between the South Pacific and Hawai’i is alongthe Line Islands, which straddle the equator 1,400 km south ofHawai’i. The presence of several species (or genetic lineages) in the
Line Islands and Hawai’i, but not elsewhere in the Pacific,
confirms this avenue of dispersal [24], [25]. Therefore, naturalcolonization of the Hawaiian Islands by this parasite remains apossibility.
Here, we describe a multidisciplinary approach, combining
phylogeography and population genetics with ecological surveydata from the native and introduced ranges, to resolve the","infected fish have been found in the northwest end of the
archipelago, indicating that the range of this alien parasite is still
expanding, and like that of its host L. kasmira [42], may eventually
span the entire archipelago. An abundance of host fish species in
the northwest Hawaiian Islands, and at least two native copepods
that can act as intermediate hosts for S. istiblenni (G.A. unpublished
data), both support this hypothesis.
Genetic evidence: Hawaiian populations show founder
effect
The Hawaiian population of S. istiblenni is dominated by two
haplotypes (Table 3, Fig. 4) that constitute 79% of the genetic
diversity. Only 7 haplotypes were detected in Hawai’i compared to
18 in French Polynesia (Table 2), and rarefaction analyses
confirmed the loss of genetic diversity during the initial
introduction (Fig. 5); a pattern expected but often not detectedin introduced species [43] including parasites [44] (but see also
[45]). We found no evidence of founder events (i.e. shifts in",0.9166666666361111,1.0,1.0,1.0000000000000002,0.9950735398595378,0.9305865667830662
How might the loss of competing gut parasites affect S. istiblenni in Hawai’i?,"The loss of competing gut parasites in Hawai’i may benefit S. istiblenni by allowing it to increase in prevalence and intensity. With fewer competitors for resources within the host fish, S. istiblenni could thrive more effectively, potentially leading to higher infection rates. Additionally, the reduced stress from both competitors and parasites may create a more favorable environment for S. istiblenni to flourish.","The loss of competing gut parasites in Hawai’i may benefit S. istiblenni by allowing it to increase in prevalence and intensity. Without competition from other parasites, S. istiblenni may have more resources available, leading to a higher rate of infection in host fish.

Here, we synthesize phylogeography, population genetics, and
ecological survey data to confirm the alien status of the
cryptogenic parasitic nematode S. istiblenni in Hawai’i. This species
was brought to Hawai’i over 50 years ago during well-intentionedefforts to enhance local fisheries. The outcome for fisheries has
been just the opposite, with L. kasmira regarded as a nuisance and,
by some, as a threat to native species. Here we show that the
introduced fish also brought an unwelcome passenger, S. istiblenni .
Once introduced, S. istiblenni attained a two-fold increase in
prevalence, as well as a similar increase in intensity. S. istiblenni lags
behind its primary host L. kasmira in the introduced range but there
is no obvious barrier to colonization of the entire Hawaiian","infected fish have been found in the northwest end of the
archipelago, indicating that the range of this alien parasite is still
expanding, and like that of its host L. kasmira [42], may eventually
span the entire archipelago. An abundance of host fish species in
the northwest Hawaiian Islands, and at least two native copepods
that can act as intermediate hosts for S. istiblenni (G.A. unpublished
data), both support this hypothesis.
Genetic evidence: Hawaiian populations show founder
effect
The Hawaiian population of S. istiblenni is dominated by two
haplotypes (Table 3, Fig. 4) that constitute 79% of the genetic
diversity. Only 7 haplotypes were detected in Hawai’i compared to
18 in French Polynesia (Table 2), and rarefaction analyses
confirmed the loss of genetic diversity during the initial
introduction (Fig. 5); a pattern expected but often not detectedin introduced species [43] including parasites [44] (but see also
[45]). We found no evidence of founder events (i.e. shifts in","Pacific is poorly documented, and the uncertainty in the natural
range of S. istiblenni stems from a lack of occurrence data. Outside
of Hawai’i, S. istiblenni is known only from French Polynesia and
Fiji [22], [23] (reexamination of materials from Okinawa hascalled into question the accuracy of earlier records [23]). Based onbiogeographic data from reef fish species, the most likely route ofnatural dispersal between the South Pacific and Hawai’i is alongthe Line Islands, which straddle the equator 1,400 km south ofHawai’i. The presence of several species (or genetic lineages) in the
Line Islands and Hawai’i, but not elsewhere in the Pacific,
confirms this avenue of dispersal [24], [25]. Therefore, naturalcolonization of the Hawaiian Islands by this parasite remains apossibility.

What geological features indicate the effects of wave action in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands?,"The effects of wave action in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands are indicated by geological features such as spur and groove formations, and the distribution of benthic communities. High-energy environments typically feature energy-tolerant species, such as crustose coralline algae, non-delicate fleshy algae, and encrusting Porites corals, which thrive in areas exposed to significant wave disturbances. In contrast, sheltered areas may support different species of corals and algae that require quiescent habitats.","The geological features that indicate the effects of wave action in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands include spur and groove formations, which are clearly visible in high-resolution bathymetry around Kure Atoll. Additionally, the primary benthic components on exposed reefs consist of energy-tolerant species and growth forms such as crustose coralline algae, non-delicate fleshy algae, and encrusting Porites corals, which are adapted to withstand high wave energy.
","Oceanographic and Physical SettingA Marine Biogeographic Assessment of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands 
Ocean Waves 
Common throughout the region and perhaps more signiﬁcant as a natural process affecting the geology and ecology of the Monument, are the extra-tropical storms and signiﬁcant wave events that regularly move across the North Paciﬁc in the boreal winter (Friedlander et al., 2008, Grigg et al., 2008). Among each of the islands, atolls and submerged banks of the NWHI, the distributions of species of corals and algae, and their associated ﬁsh and invertebrate assemblages are often determined not only by the ocean currents, but also by the expo­sure to ocean waves. Many species of corals and algae can only survive in sheltered or quiescent habitats. Other species; however, can survive or even thrive in the high wave-energy habitats on the northwestern fac­ing reefs that are exposed to tremendous waves caused by winter storms across the North Paciﬁc.","waves generated by the North Pacific swell, which approach from the north or northwest, 
pose the most significant wave disturbance to Hawaiian reefs (Grigg, 1998; Friedlander

cover, dominated by Pocillopora , was found along the 8.8-km-long arc of reef extending 
counterclockwise from north to west (Table 1, Fig. 2). Grigg (1998) showed that, at

How do coral reef communities relate to the tops and edges of volcanoes?,"Coral reef communities are closely related to the tops and edges of volcanoes that are at or near sea level. These areas support large and diverse coral reef communities because the volcanic structures provide a suitable habitat for coral growth. As the volcanic edifice subsides over time, reef builders (coral organisms) continue to grow vertically, maintaining the top of the volcano near sea level by creating a thick carbonate cap. This dynamic allows coral reefs to thrive in these environments, but once the volcanic structure reaches the Darwin Point, where vertical growth or net accretion of these organisms becomes zero or negative, the atoll can drown and transform into a guyot.","Coral reef communities are supported by the tops and edges of volcanoes that are at or near sea level.

Kure Atoll 
Kure Atoll is the most northwestern island in the Hawaiian chain and occupies a singular position at the “Darwin Point”: the northern extent of coral reef development, beyond which coral growth cannot keep pace with the rate of geological subsidence. Kure’s coral is still growing slightly faster than the island is subsiding. North of Kure, where growth rates are even slower, the drowned Emperor Seamounts foretell the future of Kure and all of the Hawaiian Archipelago. As Kure Atoll continues its slow migration atop the Paci ﬁ c Plate, it too will eventu-
ally slip below the surface (Grigg, 1982). 
This 29.8 million year old atoll (Clague, 
1996) is nearly circular, with a reef 9.6 km in diameter enclosing a lagoon with two islets that include over 0.81 km
2 of 
emergent land, ﬂ anked by almost 324 
km2 of coral reef habitat (Figures 3.44,","species decline is linked to lower winter water temperatures and lower average annual solar radiation (Grigg,1982), and coral development is limited by exten-sive sand shallows towards the eastern sides of the lagoons (Maragos et al.,2004).

attenuated coral development than more southerly atolls in the Hawaiian Archipelago 
with similar histories of limited human disturbance, but not markedly so. Coral colony 
average densities are also higher in all three habitats at Kure than at Pearl and Hermes 
(Kenyon et al., 2007). 
In measuring gross carbonate production by hermatypic corals on different islands 
along the Hawaiian Archipelago, Grigg (1982) calculated a minimum value at Kure, 
where he proposed that deposition by reef-building corals can no longer keep pace with 
subsidence rates and erosion, a latitudinal threshold termed the Darwin Point. Siciliano 
(2006) constructed a calcium carbonate budget for Kure Atoll which, in contrast to the 
assumptions and methods of Grigg (1982), was based on the growth rates of all the major 
coral genera in each of the three habitats, factored in the contribution of coralline algae","The tops and edges of the volcanoes,

What is the saturation horizon and its significance for calcium carbonate structures?,"The saturation horizon is the depth in the ocean at which the concentration of carbonate ions is critical for the stability of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) structures. Above this depth, calcium carbonate can precipitate and form solid structures, such as those found in corals and calcareous algae. Below the saturation horizon, calcium carbonate tends to dissolve due to the lower concentrations of carbonate ions.

The significance of the saturation horizon for calcium carbonate structures is that it determines the depth at which organisms like corals can effectively calcify and build their skeletons. As anthropogenic CO2 emissions increase, the saturation horizon moves shallower, meaning that the depth where corals can calcify becomes increasingly limited. This has implications for coral ecosystems, as it affects their ability to grow and thrive in deeper waters.","The saturation horizon is the depth in the ocean at which the concentration of carbonate ions is critical for the stability of calcium carbonate structures. Below this depth, calcium carbonate tends to dissolve due to the lower availability of carbonate ions. The significance of the saturation horizon for calcium carbonate structures, such as those formed by corals and other calcifying organisms, is that it determines the depth at which these organisms can effectively calcify. As more CO2 is released into the atmosphere, the saturation horizon moves shallower, meaning that the depth at which corals can calcify will also become shallower, potentially impacting their growth and survival.
","3 secreting organisms. The ﬁrst is calcite, which is 
the less soluble form found in crustose coraline algaes, and the other is the aragonite form of calcium carbonate, which is 
utilized by scleractinian corals and other pteropods. There is a critical concentration of carbonate ions in seawater below which calcium carbonate will dissolve. The solubility of calcium carbonate is a function of depth and pressure. The critical concentration occurs at a depth known as the “saturation horizon”, under which calcium carbonate structures tend to dis­solve. Due to increased amounts of CO
2 in seawater and the resultant decrease in the carbonate ion concentration (equa­
tion 2) the saturation horizon will move ever shallower with increasing releases of anthropogenic CO2 into the atmosphere. 
This means that the depth at which corals are able to calcify will grow shallower as more CO2 is input into the atmosphere.","This means that the depth at which corals are able to calcify will grow shallower as more CO2 is input into the atmosphere. 
Latitude also plays a role when looking at where saturation boundaries occur. Lower latitudes near the equator tend to have saturation states conducive to the solidi ﬁed structure of corals, while poleward areas are already showing evidence 
of undersaturation at the surface waters. Currently the surface waters of the NWHI still fall within saturation parameters (Feely et al., 2002).","2 in the

Evidence of undersaturation has been reported in the Intermediate Paci ﬁc in relatively shallow waters of be­
tween 200 m and 1,000 m (Feely et al., 2002). This is of concern to the NWHI deepwater habitat which for 
these purposes will be de ﬁ ned as depths greater than 50 m. A number of corals have identi ﬁed habitat ranging",0.9999999999666667,1.0,0.8888888888888888,0.9749310565360272,0.992853279995155,0.7482133199987888
How does increased CO2 in seawater affect the saturation horizon and coral calcification?,"Increased CO2 in seawater leads to a decrease in the concentration of carbonate ions, which in turn affects the saturation horizon. The saturation horizon is the depth at which calcium carbonate structures, such as those produced by corals, tend to dissolve. As more CO2 is released into the atmosphere and absorbed by the ocean, the saturation horizon moves shallower. This means that the depth at which corals are able to calcify also becomes shallower, making it more challenging for corals to maintain their calcium carbonate structures in increasingly acidified waters.","Increased CO2 in seawater leads to a decrease in the concentration of carbonate ions. This results in the saturation horizon moving shallower, meaning that the depth at which calcium carbonate structures, such as those formed by corals, can remain stable becomes shallower. As a consequence, the ability of corals to calcify is negatively impacted, as they require a certain concentration of carbonate ions to build their calcium carbonate structures. Therefore, with more CO2 input into the atmosphere, coral calcification is hindered due to the changing conditions in seawater.
","3 secreting organisms. The ﬁrst is calcite, which is 
the less soluble form found in crustose coraline algaes, and the other is the aragonite form of calcium carbonate, which is 
utilized by scleractinian corals and other pteropods. There is a critical concentration of carbonate ions in seawater below which calcium carbonate will dissolve. The solubility of calcium carbonate is a function of depth and pressure. The critical concentration occurs at a depth known as the “saturation horizon”, under which calcium carbonate structures tend to dis­solve. Due to increased amounts of CO
2 in seawater and the resultant decrease in the carbonate ion concentration (equa­
tion 2) the saturation horizon will move ever shallower with increasing releases of anthropogenic CO2 into the atmosphere. 
This means that the depth at which corals are able to calcify will grow shallower as more CO2 is input into the atmosphere.","This means that the depth at which corals are able to calcify will grow shallower as more CO2 is input into the atmosphere.

are underway to establish a baseline of the carbonate chemistry of the NWHI. This would be done by utiliz­
ing the CTD (conductivity, temperature, depth) sensor scanner onboard R/V Hiialakai and outﬁtting it with a 
pH sensor. Carbonate chemistry of a water sample can be characterized by taking three measurements; the dissolved inorganic carbon, alkalinity and pH. All three of these measurements are planned to be performed onboard during regular CTD casts and the seawater samples brought back for further analysis. These types of measurements, taken from deepwater habitats and lagoon waters (from small boat platforms) will help the Monument to develop an understanding of the current carbonate chemistry of the waters and allow us to moni­tor future changes.
