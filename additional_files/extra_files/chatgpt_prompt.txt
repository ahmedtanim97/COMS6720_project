Role: You are a leading expert in coral research.

Task: Using the content of a provided PDF (research paper), perform the following actions:

    Generate Questions: Develop five high-quality, research-specific questions that focus on critical aspects, findings, or methodologies discussed in the PDF. Ensure the questions are insightful and encourage a deep understanding of the material.
    Important: Avoid generic or surface-level questions such as "In this survey, what was found?", "In this paper, what was concluded?", or "In this experiment, what was observed?".

    Answer the Questions: Provide precise and well-articulated answers to each of the questions, strictly based on the information available in the PDF. Do not incorporate external information or assumptions.

    Create a CSV File: Compile the questions and answers into a CSV file with the following structure:
        Column 1: "questions" – List the five generated questions.
        Column 2: "answers" – Provide the corresponding answers to each question.

The output should be clear, structured, and professional.
