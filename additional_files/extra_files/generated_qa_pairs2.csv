What is the average number of parasites per host for infected fish in Hawai’i?,The average number of parasites per host for infected fish in Hawai’i is 1.9 times more than in the native range.,"Hawai’i are parasitized by S. istiblenni compared to the native
range and infected fish have an average of 1.9 times more parasites
per host, a finding that is again similar to the trematodes that
infect Japanese marine mud snails in the Eastern Pacific [44]. The
increased prevalence and intensity of S. istiblenni in Hawai’i raise
the possibility that this parasite benefits from the loss of competing
gut parasites [54]–[][56]. Alternatively, the increase in prevalence
ofS. istiblenni may reflect favorable habitat in a host fish
experiencing reduced stress from both competitors and parasites.Finally, favorable extrinsic factors such as large host populations
(including intermediate and definitive hosts) or the presence of
alternative hosts not found in the native range, could enhance
transmission and lead to increased infection rates in the introduced
range. None of these scenarios are mutually exclusive and all could
be working in conjunction to result in increased prevalence and"
What factors may contribute to the increased prevalence of S. istiblenni in Hawai’i?,"The increased prevalence of S. istiblenni in Hawai’i may be contributed by several factors:

1. **Loss of Competing Gut Parasites**: The absence of competing gut parasites may allow S. istiblenni to thrive and increase in prevalence.

2. **Reduced Stress in Host Fish**: Host fish may experience reduced stress from both competitors and parasites, creating a more favorable environment for S. istiblenni.

3. **Favorable Habitat**: The habitat in Hawai’i may be more conducive to the survival and reproduction of S. istiblenni compared to its native range.

4. **Large Host Populations**: The presence of large populations of host fish, including both intermediate and definitive hosts, could enhance the transmission of the parasite.

5. **Presence of Alternative Hosts**: The availability of alternative hosts that are not found in the native range may also facilitate increased infection rates.

These factors may work in conjunction to result in the observed increase in prevalence and intensity of S. istiblenni in Hawai’i.","Hawai’i are parasitized by S. istiblenni compared to the native

How does the presence of alternative hosts affect the transmission of S. istiblenni in the introduced range?,"The presence of alternative hosts not found in the native range could enhance the transmission of S. istiblenni, leading to increased infection rates in the introduced range. This suggests that having additional hosts available may facilitate the spread and establishment of the parasite, contributing to its higher prevalence in that area.","Hawai’i are parasitized by S. istiblenni compared to the native

What types of marine habitats are described in the assessment?,"The assessment describes marine habitats that include basalt surfaces exposed to high wave action, wave-cut benches, deeply cut sand channels and chasms in deeper water, and habitats with minimal reef growth in shallow waters.

What is the Darwin Point and its significance in atoll formation?,"The Darwin Point is the threshold where the vertical growth, or net accretion, of reef-building organisms is zero or negative. At this point, an atoll can no longer maintain its structure as the volcanic edifice subsides, leading to the atoll drowning and becoming a guyot. It marks a significant milestone in the life of a Hawaiian volcano, indicating the transition from a thriving atoll to a submerged feature. The concept was first proposed by Charles Darwin in 1836 as part of his evolutionary model for atoll formation.","The tops and edges of the volcanoes, 
if they are at or near sea level, support large and diverse coral reef communi­ties. As the volcanic edi ﬁ ce subsides, 
an atoll can form as reef builders keep the top of the volcano near sea level by growing vertically and creating a thick carbonate cap. The Darwin Point marks the threshold where vertical growth, or net accretion, of reef building organisms is zero or negative and the atoll drowns and becomes a guyot (Figure 3.3; Grigg et al., 2008). This point, named after Charles Darwin, who ﬁrst proposed an 
evolutionary model for atoll formation in 1836, marks a signi ﬁcant milestone in the life of a Hawaiian volcano. 
Currently Kure Atoll lies very near its Darwin Point. It is the oldest Hawaiian island still above sea level although it consists of only 1 km
2 of emergent land and 66 km2 of lagoon (Juvik and Juvik, 1998). Dozens of seamounts"
How do coral reef communities relate to the tops and edges of volcanoes?,"Coral reef communities thrive on the tops and edges of volcanoes that are at or near sea level. These areas provide suitable conditions for the growth of reef-building organisms, which can create diverse and large coral reef ecosystems. As the volcanic structure subsides, these organisms continue to grow vertically, maintaining the top of the volcano near sea level and potentially leading to the formation of an atoll.","The tops and edges of the volcanoes,

What is the current status of Kure Atoll in relation to its Darwin Point?,"Kure Atoll currently lies very near its Darwin Point.

What are the two forms of calcium carbonate mentioned in the text?,The two forms of calcium carbonate mentioned in the text are calcite and aragonite.,"3 secreting organisms. The ﬁrst is calcite, which is 
the less soluble form found in crustose coraline algaes, and the other is the aragonite form of calcium carbonate, which is 
utilized by scleractinian corals and other pteropods. There is a critical concentration of carbonate ions in seawater below which calcium carbonate will dissolve. The solubility of calcium carbonate is a function of depth and pressure. The critical concentration occurs at a depth known as the “saturation horizon”, under which calcium carbonate structures tend to dis­solve. Due to increased amounts of CO
2 in seawater and the resultant decrease in the carbonate ion concentration (equa­
tion 2) the saturation horizon will move ever shallower with increasing releases of anthropogenic CO2 into the atmosphere. 
This means that the depth at which corals are able to calcify will grow shallower as more CO2 is input into the atmosphere."
What is the saturation horizon and its significance for calcium carbonate structures?,"The saturation horizon is the depth in the ocean at which the concentration of carbonate ions is critical for the stability of calcium carbonate structures. Below this depth, calcium carbonate tends to dissolve due to increased solubility influenced by factors such as depth and pressure. The significance of the saturation horizon for calcium carbonate structures, such as those formed by corals and certain algae, is that it marks the limit where these structures can remain intact. As anthropogenic CO2 increases in the atmosphere, leading to a decrease in carbonate ion concentration in seawater, the saturation horizon moves shallower. This means that the depth at which corals can effectively calcify becomes shallower, potentially threatening their survival and growth as they may be unable to maintain their calcium carbonate structures in increasingly acidic conditions.","3 secreting organisms.

the less soluble form found in crustose coraline algaes, and the other is the aragonite form of calcium carbonate, which is

How does increased CO2 in seawater affect the saturation horizon and coral calcification?,"Increased CO2 in seawater leads to a decrease in the concentration of carbonate ions. As a result, the saturation horizon, which is the depth below which calcium carbonate structures tend to dissolve, moves shallower. This means that the depth at which corals can effectively calcify also becomes shallower, making it more challenging for corals to maintain their calcium carbonate structures as more CO2 is released into the atmosphere.","3 secreting organisms.
