1 I NTRODUCTION
We consider the problem of classifying nodes (such as documents) in a graph (such as a citation
network), where labels are only available for a small subset of nodes. This problem can be framed
as graph-based semi-supervised learning, where label information is smoothed over the graph via
some form of explicit graph-based regularization (Zhu et al., 2003; Zhou et al., 2004; Belkin et al.,
2006; Weston et al., 2012), e.g. by using a graph Laplacian regularization term in the loss function:
L= L0 + λLreg , with Lreg =
∑
i,j
Aij∥f(Xi) −f(Xj)∥2 = f(X)⊤∆f(X) . (1)
Here, L0 denotes the supervised loss w.r.t. the labeled part of the graph,f(·) can be a neural network-
like differentiable function, λ is a weighing factor and X is a matrix of node feature vectors Xi.","In the experiments demonstrated here, our method for semi-supervised node classiﬁcation outper-
forms recent related methods by a signiﬁcant margin. Methods based on graph-Laplacian regular-
ization (Zhu et al., 2003; Belkin et al., 2006; Weston et al., 2012) are most likely limited due to their
assumption that edges encode mere similarity of nodes. Skip-gram based methods on the other hand
are limited by the fact that they are based on a multi-step pipeline which is difﬁcult to optimize.
Our proposed model can overcome both limitations, while still comparing favorably in terms of ef-
ﬁciency (measured in wall-clock time) to related methods. Propagation of feature information from
neighboring nodes in every layer improves classiﬁcation performance in comparison to methods like
ICA (Lu & Getoor, 2003), where only label information is aggregated.

4.6. Network Depth Study of Graph U-Nets
Since the network depth in terms of the number of blocks in
encoder and decoder parts is an important hyper-parameter
in the g-U-Nets, we conduct experiments to investigate the
relationship between network depth and performance in
terms of node classiﬁcation accuracy. We use different
network depths on node classiﬁcation tasks and report the
classiﬁcation accuracies. The results are summarized in Ta-
ble 7. We can observe from the results that the performance","Figure 1. Training error (left) and test error (right) on CIFAR-10

Driven by the signiﬁcance of depth, a question arises: Is
learning better networks as easy as stacking more layers?
An obstacle to answering this question was the notorious
problem of vanishing/exploding gradients [1, 9], which
hamper convergence from the beginning. This problem,
however, has been largely addressed by normalized initial-
ization [23, 9, 37, 13] and intermediate normalization layers
[16], which enable networks with tens of layers to start con-
verging for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with back-
propagation [22].
When deeper networks are able to start converging, a
degradation problem has been exposed: with the network
depth increasing, accuracy gets saturated (which might be",0.9999999999,1.0,0.6,0.9973937242648057,0.9309556951725252,0.6613103523645599

be stored in memory for an exact procedure. For very large and densely connected graph datasets,
further approximations might be necessary.

"What role does the activation function, specifically ReLU, play in the performance of deep learning models with varying layer counts?","The activation function ReLU has a less severe impact on the performance of ResNet models with fewer layers (e.g., 164 layers), where the training curve may initially suffer but improves quickly.

We also ﬁnd that the impact of f = ReLU is not severe when the ResNet
has fewer layers ( e.g., 164 in Fig. 6(right)). The training curve seems to suﬀer
a little bit at the beginning of training, but goes into a healthy status soon. By
monitoring the responses we observe that this is because after some training,
the weights are adjusted into a status such that yl in Eqn.(1) is more frequently
above zero and f does not truncate it (xl is always non-negative due to the pre-
vious ReLU, so yl is below zero only when the magnitude of Fis very negative).
The truncation, however, is more frequent when there are 1000 layers.","The activation function, specifically ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), plays a significant role in the performance of deep learning models, particularly in very deep networks. In the context of ResNet architectures with varying layer counts, the following points can be noted:

1. **Signal Propagation**: ReLU helps in propagating the signal through the network. In deeper networks, such as those with 1000 layers, the use of ReLU can lead to truncation of negative values, which may hinder learning. However, when the network is trained sufficiently, the weights can adjust such that the outputs of the layers are more frequently above zero, allowing ReLU to function effectively.

2. **Impact on Training**: The impact of ReLU is less severe in networks with fewer layers (e.g., ResNet-164) compared to those with many layers (e.g., ResNet-1001). In shallower networks, the training curve may initially suffer but tends to stabilize as training progresses. In deeper networks, the truncation effect of ReLU becomes more pronounced, which can affect the learning dynamics.

3. **Pre-activation vs. Post-activation**: The position of the ReLU activation (whether it is applied before or after the addition of shortcut connections) also influences performance. Full pre-activation (where both Batch Normalization and ReLU are applied before weight layers) has been shown to improve results significantly compared to other configurations.

4. **Optimization**: The combination of ReLU with Batch Normalization (BN) in a pre-activation setup allows for better optimization, as it enables more direct signal propagation between units, leading to lower training loss and improved performance.

In summary, ReLU's role in deep learning models is crucial for effective signal propagation, influencing training dynamics, and optimizing performance, especially in deeper architectures.","ResNet-110 6.61 6.37

The distinction between post-activation/pre-activation is caused by the pres-
ence of the element-wise addition. For a plain network that has N layers, there
are N −1 activations (BN/ReLU), and it does not matter whether we think of
them as post- or pre-activations. But for branched layers merged by addition,
the position of activation matters.
We experiment with two such designs: (i) ReLU-only pre-activation (Fig. 4(d)),
and (ii) full pre-activation (Fig. 4(e)) where BN and ReLU are both adopted be-
fore weight layers. Table 2 shows that the ReLU-only pre-activation performs

This can improve the classification accuracy of objects, especially in complex scenes where context plays a crucial role in identifying objects.

is a regressed box that is different from its proposal box. So
for inference, we pool a new feature from the regressed box
and obtain a new classiﬁcation score and a new regressed
box. We combine these 300 new predictions with the orig-
inal 300 predictions. Non-maximum suppression (NMS) is
applied on the union set of predicted boxes using an IoU

In this section we introduce our detection method based

initialized by the ImageNet classiﬁcation models, and then
ﬁne-tuned on the object detection data. We have experi-
mented with ResNet-50/101 at the time of the ILSVRC &
COCO 2015 detection competitions.
Unlike VGG-16 used in [32], our ResNet has no hidden
fc layers. We adopt the idea of “Networks on Conv fea-
ture maps” (NoC) [33] to address this issue. We compute
the full-image shared conv feature maps using those lay-
ers whose strides on the image are no greater than 16 pixels
(i.e., conv1, conv2 x, conv3 x, and conv4 x, totally 91 conv
layers in ResNet-101; Table 1). We consider these layers as
analogous to the 13 conv layers in VGG-16, and by doing
so, both ResNet and VGG-16 have conv feature maps of the

What are the advantages of using a technique that accesses the entirety of the neighborhood in graph evaluation?,"The advantages of using a technique that accesses the entirety of the neighborhood in graph evaluation include not suffering from the limitations of fixed-size neighborhood sampling, which can restrict the information available during inference. This approach allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the node's context, potentially leading to better performance. Additionally, it does not assume any specific ordering within the neighborhood, which can simplify the processing and improve the model's flexibility compared to methods that rely on sequential node ordering.","where the model is evaluated on graphs that are completely unseen during training.
•The recently published inductive method of Hamilton et al. (2017) samples a ﬁxed-size
neighborhood of each node, in order to keep its computational footprint consistent; this
does not allow it access to the entirety of the neighborhood while performing inference.
Moreover, this technique achieved some of its strongest results when an LSTM (Hochreiter
& Schmidhuber, 1997)-based neighborhood aggregator is used. This assumes the existence
of a consistent sequential node ordering across neighborhoods, and the authors have rec-
tiﬁed it by consistently feeding randomly-ordered sequences to the LSTM. Our technique
does not suffer from either of these issues—it works with the entirety of the neighborhood
(at the expense of a variable computational footprint, which is still on-par with methods
like the GCN), and does not assume any ordering within it.","The advantages of using a technique that accesses the entirety of the neighborhood in graph evaluation include:

1. **Increased Model Capacity**: By observing the entire neighborhood, the model can leverage more information, which can lead to improved predictive power and performance.

2. **Variable Computational Footprint**: While it may have a variable computational footprint, it can still be on-par with other methods like GCNs, allowing for flexibility in processing.

3. **No Assumption of Node Ordering**: Unlike some methods that require a consistent sequential node ordering, this technique does not assume any ordering within the neighborhood, making it more versatile.

4. **Improved Interpretability**: Analyzing the learned attentional weights can enhance interpretability, similar to benefits seen in other domains like machine translation.

5. **Applicability to Inductive Learning**: The technique is directly applicable to inductive learning tasks, including scenarios where the model is evaluated on completely unseen graphs during training.

6. **Weight Assignment**: It allows for assigning different weights to nodes within the same neighborhood, which can be beneficial for capturing the varying importance of different neighbors. 

Overall, these advantages contribute to better performance and flexibility in graph-based learning tasks.","where the model is evaluated on graphs that are completely unseen during training.

speciﬁcally, we are able to improve upon GCNs by a margin of 1.5% and 1.6% on Cora and Cite-
seer, respectively, suggesting that assigning different weights to nodes of a same neighborhood may
be beneﬁcial. It is worth noting the improvements achieved on the PPI dataset: Our GAT model
improves by 20.5% w.r.t. the best GraphSAGE result we were able to obtain, demonstrating that our
model has the potential to be applied in inductive settings, and that larger predictive power can be
leveraged by observing the entire neighborhood. Furthermore, it improves by 3.9% w.r.t. Const-GAT

the learned attentional weights may lead to beneﬁts in interpretability, as was the case in
the machine translation domain (e.g. the qualitative analysis of Bahdanau et al. (2015)).
•The attention mechanism is applied in a shared manner to all edges in the graph, and there-
fore it does not depend on upfront access to the global graph structure or (features of) all of
its nodes (a limitation of many prior techniques). This has several desirable implications:
– The graph is not required to be undirected (we may simply leave out computingαij if
edge j →iis not present).
– It makes our technique directly applicable to inductive learning—including tasks
where the model is evaluated on graphs that are completely unseen during training.

GraphSAGE approaches. To evaluate the beneﬁts of aggregating across the entire neighborhood,
we further provide (as GraphSAGE∗) the best result we were able to achieve with GraphSAGE by
just modifying its architecture (this was with a three-layer GraphSAGE-LSTM with [512, 512, 726]
features computed in each layer and 128 features used for aggregating neighborhoods). Finally,
we report the 10-run result of our constant attention GAT model (as Const-GAT), to fairly evaluate
the beneﬁts of the attention mechanism against a GCN-like aggregation scheme (with the same
architecture).

with our work, an Inception-ResNet-v2 model [21] achieves a single-crop result

But we did ﬁnish a “BN after addition” version (Fig. 4(b)) of ResNet-101 on
ImageNet and observed higher training loss and validation error. This model’s
single-crop (224×224) validation error is 24.6%/7.5%, vs. the original ResNet-
101’s 23.6%/7.1%. This is in line with the results on CIFAR in Fig. 6 (left).
Table 5 shows the results of ResNet-152 [1] and ResNet-2003, all trained from
scratch. We notice that the original ResNet paper [1] trained the models using
scale jittering with shorter side s∈[256,480], and so the test of a 224 ×224 crop
on s= 256 (as did in [1]) is negatively biased. Instead, we test a single 320 ×320
crop from s = 320, for all original and our ResNets. Even though the ResNets
are trained on smaller crops, they can be easily tested on larger crops because","we compare with the previous best single-model results.

itive accuracy. Our 152-layer ResNet has a single-model
top-5 validation error of 4.49%. This single-model result
outperforms all previous ensemble results (Table 5). We
combine six models of different depth to form an ensemble

This leads to 3.57% top-5 error on the test set (Table 5).

4.2. CIFAR-10 and Analysis
We conducted more studies on the CIFAR-10 dataset
[20], which consists of 50k training images and 10k test-
ing images in 10 classes. We present experiments trained
on the training set and evaluated on the test set. Our focus
is on the behaviors of extremely deep networks, but not on
pushing the state-of-the-art results, so we intentionally use
simple architectures as follows.
The plain/residual architectures follow the form in Fig. 3","to train and generalizes better than the original ResNet in [1]. We further report
improved results on ImageNet using a 200-layer ResNet, for which the counter-
part of [1] starts to overﬁt. These results suggest that there is much room to
exploit the dimension of network depth, a key to the success of modern deep
learning.
